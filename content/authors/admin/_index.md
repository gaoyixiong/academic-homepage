# Yixiong Gao [[CV]](cv_yixionggao.pdf)

I am a first-year Ph.D student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/). 

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science. Currently, I am focusing on combinatorial optimization problems.

I am highly involved with Competitive Programming. I am a contestant and have won 4 gold medals in the ICPC Regional Contests. I also serve as the chief judge and set problems for multiple official contests including ICPC Asia EC Regionals Online Selection Contests.
