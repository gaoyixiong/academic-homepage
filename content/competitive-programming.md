I am highly involved with Competitive Programming. I started doing competitive programming in high school. I won a Bronze Medal in the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO) 2019. 

Then, I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Hangzhou Dianzi University, where I competed as the team leader (2020-2023) and served as the student coach (2022-2023). 

After that, I joined the Competitive Programming Team of the City University of Hong Kong, where I competed as the team leader (2023-2025) and served as the student coach (2023-2025). 

In my competitive programming career, I won five gold medals in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) regional contests and three gold medals in the China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) series contests. 

I am a member of the [Universal Cup](https://ucup.ac/) Organizing Committee. I also served as the chief judge and set problems for multiple official contests, including the ICPC Asia East Continent Online Selection Contests (48th and 49th). 

You can also find me on [Universal Cup](https://ucup.ac/about/members/#yixiong-gao), [QOJ](https://qoj.ac/user/profile/SGColin), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/SGColin), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/u/yixionggao/).
