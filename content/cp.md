I am highly involved with Competitive Programming. I started doing competitive programming in high school. I received a Bronze Medal in the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO) 2019. 

Then, I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Hangzhou Dianzi University, where I competed as the team leader (2020-2023) and served as the student coach (2022-2023). 

After that, I joined the Competitive Programming Team of the City University of Hong Kong, competed as the team leader (2023-2025), and served as the student coach (2023-2025). 

In my competitive programming career, I won 5 gold medals in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) regional contests and 3 gold medals in the China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) series contests. 

I also serve as the chief judge and set problems for multiple official contests, including the ICPC Asia EC Regionals Online Selection Contests (48th and 49th).
